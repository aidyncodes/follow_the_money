Features (Planned):
Pull real-time data from sources like USAspending.gov and GAO audit reports.
Visualize allocations vs. actual expenditures 
Display interactive dashboards for both federal and state budgets. 

Tech Stack:

Status:
This project is in early development.

Purpose:
Government budgets are complex, and frequent changes or cuts can make it hard to follow how funds are allocated and spent. 
This project aims to provide a clear, accessible way to visualize public spending and audit outcomes.
